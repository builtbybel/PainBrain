# **PaneBrain (ProjectMnemonic)**

**PaneBrain** is a lightweight, portable desktop app that captures screenshots, uses AI ([BLIP](https://github.com/salesforce/BLIP)) to generate detailed descriptions, and lets you search through your captures with ease ‚Äì all running **locally** on your machine.

Right now, I‚Äôm running this project under the name **‚ÄúPaneBrain‚Äù** or **‚ÄúPanebrain‚Äù** . And just to make sure, I'm avoiding any potential issues with MS by not using **WinRecall** as the final name. üòâ

What started as my personal tool for archiving documents using **Tesseract OCR** has evolved over time with a deep learning model to generate rich, natural-language descriptions of your screenshots. So, if you don‚Äôt want to spend a fortune on a Copilot+PC (the only way to get Microsoft Recall), this is your **open-source** alternative.

## **How It Works**  

1. **Capture & Process:** The app **captures your main screen** at regular intervals.  
2. **AI Descriptions:** Each screenshot is analyzed, and a detailed **text description** is generated.  
3. **Search & Retrieve:** Screenshots and their descriptions are indexed in a local **SQLite database**, making them searchable by keywords.  
4. **Controls:** Hit **"Capture"** to start, **"Stop"** to pause, and manage your saved images through the database settings.

1. The app will automatically install Python (if needed) and set up all the required dependencies.
2. Once everything‚Äôs set up, restart the pc and you‚Äôre good to go!
