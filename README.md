# WinRecall

**WinRecall** is a local and portalble desktop application that periodically captures screenshots of your screen, uses AI (via [BLIP](https://github.com/salesforce/BLIP)) to generate detailed descriptions for each image, and allows you to search and retrieve those screenshots based on their generated descriptionsâ€”all running locally on your machine.

This project started as a personal tool to archive documents using Tesseract OCR. Over time, I supercharged it with a deep learning model to generate rich, natural-language descriptions of screen captures. For anyone who doesnâ€™t want to splurge on a Copilot+PC (the only way to get the original Microsoft Recall), this replica is available for you to test right on your desktop!

## Features

### ðŸ–¼Automated Screenshot Capture
Periodically captures your screen (every few seconds) and saves the images in a dedicated folder.

### AI-Powered Image Descriptions
Uses **BLIP** (via the Hugging Face Transformers library) to generate detailed, natural-language descriptions for every screenshot. It's like giving your screen captures a voice!

### Local Search & Retrieval
Indexes the screenshot file paths, AI-generated descriptions, and timestamps in a local SQLite database, making it super easy to search and retrieve past captures based on keywords. Find your screenshots without any hassle.

## How to Run

Before running the app, simply execute the provided `setup.bat` file. This batch file will:

1. Check if Python is installed.
2. If Python isn't found, it will guide you through the installation process.
3. Upgrade `pip` and install the required packages.

If Python is already set up, just run `WinRecallApp.exe` and youâ€™re good to go!
